It was difficult trying to remember the basics for coding, I had to look at some past assignment
to remember how to structure it. I wasnt sure what a "main theme" was, So i just added info about myself and a memory about a game.
I do not understand how these files should be arranged, the wording and pictures confused me. I will be asking for more help from Cassens about this.
