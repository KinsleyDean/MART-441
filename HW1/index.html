            <h1>A Memory</h1>
            <p> A memory of playing a game that I am fond of is when my brothers first met my fiance.
                 He came over one day to hang out with my family, and my brothers wanted to play the game "Sorry!".
                 all of them were teaming up and battling against me during that game. It wasn't fun to lose everytime,
                 but they all thought it was super funny and they worked toggether.My brothers and fiance bonded a lot that day,
                so it is a very happy memory.</p>
                <br />
                <p> Games are a great way to bring people together. It help people have fun, make friends, and can even be used to help
                    teach people. Most people learn the best if there is a "fun" quality to the subject at hand. 
                </p>
