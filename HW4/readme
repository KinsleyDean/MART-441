I had a very difficul time this week. Trying to remmeber variables, functions and if statments was super difficult. I tried to relearn them as best as I could, and use them in coding. Cassens said I should visualize my assignment first then use the weeks info to help the assignemnt, instead of learning the weeks info and then creating a project. He also told me to draw it out so i can see how it should look. I think this helped a lot and that I should keep trying it. I eventually have gotten it to work, and it is very simple. I am looking for a tutor. Hopefully I can find someone who will help me this semster.
