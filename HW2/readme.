This week was very rough. I made the consol.log informations/answers, and put in the colors, words, and picture on the website. 
I had ChatGPT help me with the prompt section becuase I did not understand how to make it or where to put it, I hope I got it right on my first try.
I would probably feel much less stressed if I only used the AI, if i let it do all the work, but I hate not understanding my schoolwork so I dont think
that I would use it for everything. In the end,I wouldnt be learning anything. No I could not explain most of the code that it would spit out, I barely understand it
even with pages of readings and videos. No the work would not be mine, I think I would mostly only use the AI if I really cant understand how the code works
and I need urgent help with it.
