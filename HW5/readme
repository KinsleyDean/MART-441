When giving chatGPT the assignment prompt for the memory card game, it came up with a pretty detailed code. Firstly, it gave a very nice look to the website and to the individual "cards" themselves. There were lots of diffent coding that I havent learned about when it comes to desing in websites. It coded the amount of cards and their names differently, by doubling up image names. It also used const. variables into the mix for the board, cards, and blank image. It also added in the  functions that removed mathced cards and flipped cards back over that were not matched. Otherwise looked like a more complicated code then what I had, And added next weeks work, but It was cool to see what it came up with by itself.
My experience this wekk was a little hectic with losing access to my Canvas last wekk and having to cathc up on week 4, but this week went pretty smoothly. I got more done on my own, and needed a bit less help from Cassens. The biggest things that alwasy get me in code are the little details. I seem to always miss the small things that the computer doesn't register as the same thing,like jpg and jpeg. I need to have better attention to detail in this kind of thing. I am excited to move on and get this memory game working though, to say I actually created another functional website game.
